# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# API Routes for Backend Services
# Used by Inngest functions to call our backend APIs.
# Ensure these are correctly set to where your backend services are running.
STYLETTS2_API_ROUTE="http://localhost:8001" # Example port for StyleTTS2
SEED_VC_API_ROUTE="http://localhost:8000"   # Example port for SeedVC (now Gemini TTS)
MAKE_AN_AUDIO_API_ROUTE="http://localhost:8002" # Example port for Make-An-Audio

# API Key for securing backend services
# This key is sent in the Authorization header to your FastAPI backends.
# Ensure this matches the API_KEY in the .env files of your backend services.
BACKEND_API_KEY="your_secure_backend_api_key"

# Gemini API Key (for SeedVC service)
# This key is used by the SeedVC service (which now uses Gemini for Text-to-Speech).
# The SeedVC backend reads this from its own environment variables, not directly by the frontend.
# This is listed here for completeness of backend requirements.
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
